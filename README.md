This is a virtual assistant created by me using Python in Visual Studio Code. Right no, it can do simple tasks like search something on Wikipedia, open VS code, open YouTube and play music. (Be SURE TO change the directories of the apps!).
You all can add additional features as per your requirement. (the assistant will only work in vs code after running the code.)
